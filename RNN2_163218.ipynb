    "\n",
    "The generated text (\"there was far was was was was was...\") indicates that the SimpleRNN struggles to maintain context and introduces significant repetition. This is common for SimpleRNN layers because they tend to lose context over longer sequences, causing the model to repeat the same words.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observations on the Modified Code:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The modified model generates text with slightly more variety (\"there was far was was small village village village...\"). Although there’s still repetition, the LSTM and increased embedding size help capture more meaningful word associations like \"small\" and \"village.\" This improvement demonstrates that the model is learning some contextual relationships, though it’s still prone to repetition."
